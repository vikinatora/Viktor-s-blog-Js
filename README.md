# My project for JS-Web course for Softuni using React as a mandatory front-end library, node.js(expess.js) for the backend and MongoDb.

This project is a personal blog where only the admin can create posts and other users can comment and reply to each other with dynamically generated categories dropdown menu. Users can search posts by category using the dropdown menu or with their own search query using the search form.
The admin can access admin-only panel in which he can edit and delete posts.
